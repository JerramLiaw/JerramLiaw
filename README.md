Thank you for visiting my profile!

My main goal is to use GitHub as a place for me to keep track of my learning - through personal notes, personal projects or contributing to open source ones.

I am interested in learning and making projects in a variety of programming languages and software:

* **Proficient in**: Microsoft Excel, Visual Basic for Applications, PowerShell, R 
* **Familiar with**: Python, T-SQL, PowerBI

I take time off daily to read up, make notes or work on projects to learn more and keep up to date with the above software.
